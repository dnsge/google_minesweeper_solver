This program takes a screenshot of the display, analyzes the colors present, and determines which moves to make.

Press 'Play' and then run the program. Sometimes the game will end up in unsolvable situations where a guess is needed. In that case, you can take a guess yourself and continue the program. However, do not manually flag tiles as the program does not check flags from the display, but from a list that is updated after each flag placement.
